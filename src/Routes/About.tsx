        <p className="mb-4">
          Welcome to Dr. Tomer Chen's final project for the .NET course at
          HackerU! This project required developing both the frontend and
          backend for a web app.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The backend was built using ASP.NET API, and the frontend was created
          using React + TypeScript, styled with Tailwind (with minimal CSS
          adjustments). The app is hosted on Azureâ€™s free hosting service, so it
          may be a touch slow at times.
        </p>{" "}
        <p className="mb-4">
          Here's what it offers as a dynamic social media platform:
